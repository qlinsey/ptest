                                <h5>TITLE: Understanding Multi-channel Customer Behavior</h5>
                                <p>Online shopping is gaining popularity. Traditional retailers with physical stores adjust to this trend by allowing their customers to shop online as well as offline, in-store. Increasingly, customers can browse and purchase products across multiple shopping channels. Understanding how customer behavior relates to the availability of multiple shopping channels is an important prerequisite for many downstream machine learning tasks, such as recommendation and purchase prediction. However, previous work in this domain is limited to analyzing single-channel behavior only. In this talk, I share insights into multi-channel customer behavior in retail based on a large sample of 2.8 million transactions originating from 300,000 customers of a food retailer in Europe. Our analysis reveals significant differences in customer behavior across online and offline channels, for example with respect to the repeat ratio of item purchases and basket size. Based on these findings, we investigate the performance of a next basket recommendation model under multi-channel settings. We find that the recommendation performance differs significantly for customers based on their choice of shopping channel, which strongly indicates that future research on recommenders in this area should take into account the particular characteristics of multi-channel retail shopping. </p> <br>

                                <h5>TITLE: Building Multi Modal Search and Recommender Systems at Scale </h5>
                                <p>In the recent years we have witnessed a significant increase of e-commerce shopping especially during the pandemic when most people shifted to online shopping due to the lockdown or to shop safely from home. Therefore, e-commerce platforms have become a crucial part of any retail business and thus retailers started to invest more in improving their digital stores by focusing on providing customers with the best experience where they can find whatever they need in a frictionless way. 
                                    
                                Product discoverability is a core function in any e-commerce platform and building intelligent information retrieval systems like Search and Recommender systems which can help customers find what they need without much effort is very important to the success of any online shopping platform. In this talk I’ll present how we leveraged different AI techniques to build intelligent search and recommendation engines to improve product discoverability and thus help customers find what they need with less effort. The talk will also cover the importance of leveraging different modality of the data to solve different discoverability problems.</p><br>

                                <h5>TITLE: Merging Representation Learning and Interactive Intelligence for User Profiling</h5>
                                <p>The pervasiveness of mobile, IoT, and sensing technologies have connected humans, physical worlds, and cyber worlds into a grand human-social-technological system. This system consists of individual users, devices, infrastructures, and cities that interact and communicate with each other in real time and at different locations. Therefore, big spatial-temporal-networked data have been accumulated from mobile devices and App services. Such spatial-temporal-networked data have unprecedented and unique complexity. In this talk, he will introduce different representation techniques and the idea that representation as a tool for user profiling. Later, he will discuss how the structured patterns in user behavioral data can be used to inform the development of advanced representation learning methods. Finally, he will discuss how interactive intelligence can be integrated into representation learning to support user profiling. </p>

                                <h5>TITLE: Efficient Network Embeddings for Large Graphs </h5>
                                <p>Given a graph G, network embedding maps each node in G into a compact, fixed-dimensional feature vector, which can be used in downstream machine learning tasks. Most of the existing methods for network embedding fail to scale to large graphs with millions of nodes, as they either incur significant computation cost or generate low-quality embeddings on such graphs. In this talk, we will present two efficient network embedding algorithms for large graphs with and without node attributes, respectively. The basic idea is to first model the affinity between nodes (or between nodes and attributes) based on random walks, and then factorize the affinity matrix to derive the embeddings. The main challenges that we address include (i) the choice of the affinity measure and (ii) the reduction of space and time overheads entailed by the construction and factorization of the affinity matrix. Extensive experiments on large graphs demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the existing methods in terms of both embedding quality and efficiency. </p> <br>
