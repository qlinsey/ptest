	                            	<p> This workshop is targeted to provide academic and industrial researchers a platform to present their latest works, share research ideas, present and discuss various challenges. Hence, we invite two kinds of contributions: <b>full research papers</b> (up to 10 pages) and <b>short papers</b> (up to 5 pages). Submissions must be in English, as PDF file, formated according to the new ACM format published in <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM guidelines</a>, selecting the generic two-column  “sigconf” sample (including references and figures). The papers can represent reports of original research, preliminary research results, or proposals for new work. The review process is single-blind.  Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, relevance to the workshop, and likelihood of generating discussion. Authors should note that changes to the author list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the PC Chairs.  At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the work at the workshop. </p>

<!-- <p>Papers presented at the workshop will be required to be uploaded to arXiv.org but will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not), although the workshop site will maintain a link to the arXiv versions. This makes the workshop a forum for the presentation and discussion of current work, without preventing the work from being published elsewhere.</p>
